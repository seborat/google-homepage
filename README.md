Project: HMTL/CSS -- The Odin Project
by: seborat

Recreating the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS learned so far.

It was harder than I thought it would be. I felt I structured the HTML fairly well. Could have been more organized, though. I really struggled with the CSS portion. Getting things to fit in the right spots was tough and I had to look at the google source code as well as other projects. Pretty happy with the outcome, but I need waaaay more practice.
